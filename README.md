Vanillacash = V(anilla)cash = Vcash
===================================

A decentralized currency for the internet.

This release is the first code update since 2018, with primary aim of democratizing mining 
(by utilizing new, ASIC-resistant algo) and introducing atomic swaps (BIP-65) compatibility.

New to this version / Major differences between this and previous version(s):
1) Algo changed to HMQ1725, with benefit of CPU-friendly mining
2) Elimination of the non-funcioning / defunct masternode functionality
3) Restoration of a more democratic and fair, UTXO-based staking mechanism

The new code will be compatible with multitude of modern platforms, eliminating problems
related to exchange / DEX / multi-wallet / ElectrumX incompatibilities.
